Project Title: Predicting Bank Customer Churn using Machine Learning

Objective:

1. Identify factors contributing to customer churn.
2. Develop a predictive model to identify high-risk customers.
3. Provide insights for targeted retention strategies.

Dataset:

- Source: Kaggle (Bank Customer Churn Dataset)
- Features:
    - CustomerID (unique identifier)
    - Gender
    - Age
    - Occupation
    - City
    - Balance
    - CreditScore
    - Tenure (months)
    - NumOfProducts
    - IsActiveMember
    - EstimatedSalary
    - Churn (target variable: 0/1)
- Sample size: 10,000 customers

Methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Handling missing values
    - Encoding categorical variables
    - Scaling/normalization
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Descriptive statistics
    - Correlation analysis
    - Visualization (heatmaps, bar charts)
3. Feature Selection:
    - Filter methods (correlation, mutual information)
    - Wrapper methods (recursive feature elimination)
4. Model Development:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Gradient Boosting
5. Model Evaluation:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-score
    - ROC-AUC
6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
    - Grid search
    - Random search

Results:

- Best-performing model: Random Forest (Accuracy: 85.2%, ROC-AUC: 0.92)
- Top contributing factors:
    - Tenure
    - Balance
    - CreditScore
    - NumOfProducts
    - EstimatedSalary

Insights:

1. Customers with low tenure (<6 months) are more likely to churn.
2. Customers with low balance (<$1,000) are more likely to churn.
3. Customers with low credit score (<600) are more likely to churn.
4. Customers with few products (<2) are more likely to churn.
5. Customers with low estimated salary (<$50,000) are more likely to churn.

Recommendations:

1. Targeted marketing campaigns for customers with low tenure.
2. Offer incentives for customers with low balance.
3. Provide credit counseling for customers with low credit score.
4. Bundle products for customers with few products.
5. Offer salary-based loan options.

Limitations:

1. Dataset limitations (e.g., missing variables).
2. Model assumptions (e.g., linearity).
3. Overfitting/underfitting.

Future Work:

1. Incorporate additional data (e.g., transaction history).
2. Experiment with deep learning models.
3. Develop a real-time churn prediction system.

This project demonstrates a basic approach to building a customer churn model using machine learning. You can expand on this by exploring more advanced techniques and incorporating additional data sources.

Code:

Here's some sample code in Python using scikit-learn and pandas:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, roc_auc_score

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('bank_customer_churn.csv')

# Preprocess data
X = df.drop('Churn', axis=1)
y = df['Churn']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print('Classification Report:')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print('ROC-AUC:', roc_auc_score(y_test, rf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]))
